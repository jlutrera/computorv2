computor-v2 is an instruction interpreter that, like a shell, retrieves user inputs for advanced
computations.
It will present the form of a simple command interpreter, and will have to be able to
answer the following specifications (features detailed in the following pages):
â€¢ Support for the following mathematical types:
     Rational numbers
     Complex numbers (with rational coefficients)
     Matrices
     Polynomial equations of degrees less than or equal to 2
â€¢ Assignment of an expression to a variable by type inference
â€¢ Reassignment of an existing variable with an expression of another type
â€¢ Assignment of a variable to another variable (existing or not)
â€¢ Resolution of a mathematical expression with or without defined variable (s)
â€¢ Resolution of an equation of degree less than or equal to 2
â€¢ Operations between types, as much as possible
â€¢ Exit the program itself (by keyword, signal, keyboard shortcut ...)
