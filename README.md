`computor-v2` is an instruction interpreter that, like a shell, retrieves user inputs for advanced computations. It will present itself as a simple command interpreter and must be able to address the following specifications:

- Support for the following mathematical types:
  - Rational numbers
  - Complex numbers (with rational coefficients)
  - Matrices
- Assignment of an expression to a variable by type inference
- Reassignment of an existing variable with an expression of another type
- Assignment of a variable to another variable
- Resolution of a mathematical expression with or without defined variable(s)
- Resolution of an equation of degree less than or equal to 3
- Operations between types, as much as possible
- Exit the program typing the command `exit`
- If you want to see the calculation process, you have to write the command `visual on` at the prompt.  If you don't, type `visual off`
- And more! 

For details, please, type the command `help` at the prompt.
